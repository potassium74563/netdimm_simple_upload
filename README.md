# NetDIMM simple upload

https://github.com/travistyoj/piforcetools and https://github.com/dev-tty0's
tools are cool. But I didn't have a Raspberry PI handy and just wanted to upload
something to my brand new NetDIMM from my Macbook.

Here's how to do that.

# Usage

- Connect your NetDIMM and your PC by ethernet
  - Use a crossover cable
  - Or a hub or switch
  - Or have your PC wirelessly connect to a gateway the NetDIMM is plugged into
  - Whatever
- Make sure they both have IP addresses
- python ./upload.py <ip_address_of_netdimm> <path_to_rom>
- Drink beers and shoot aliens

DWTFYW. But it'd be nice if you didn't use this for warez.
